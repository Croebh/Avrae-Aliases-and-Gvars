# `!conc`

This alias allows you roll concentration checks for when you take damage.

## How does it work?

You can find help in Avrae by running `!conc ?`

Running `!conc` on its own will roll a concentration check, defaulting to a DC of 10. If you fail the check, it will remove any concentration effects you have in init.

You can specify a DC with `!conc #`, so `!conc 25` would be a DC 25 (good luck!).

[![Default and set DC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/720465301329805332/733897624587075604/unknown.png)]

It attempts to account for various abilities such as the War Caster feat or if you're using Bladesong and applies them appropriately.
