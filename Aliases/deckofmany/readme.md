# `!deckofmany`

This alias allows you draw cards from a Deck of Many Things

## How does it work?

Running `!deckofmany` on its own will draw cards from a normal 13 card deck, while `!deckofmany full` will draw from the full deck.

It does *not* track what cards you have drawn previously, so duplicates would need to be rerolled.

I should ask permission to use this art at some point. When I originally made the alias it was for personal use.

The alias does not currently display the images, but it has imgur id's for each card, in case I get permission in the future.
