The healer can thus heal as many others as they want, without having to memorize whether who has rested in between heals. \n\nHaving the healed person run the commands also means they work outside `!init`. \n\n## TODO\n\n- Add informational aliases for the **Healer** character that indicate their intention to heal/stabilize someone and request the target to run `!healed` or `!stabilized`.

It should now accept dice and [descriptors].\n- Eliminated the possibility of some errors which could have arisen from invalid arguments.\n\n**17th Dec Update**\n- Updated default settings GVAR to fix formatting issues with `!XCC` and to include silvered ammunition.\n- Fixed a bug where `!A` without arguments, or with any of the `!attack` subcommands, would not return anything.\n\n**11th Dec Update**\n- `!Cast` now supports the `ritual` argument. This will not use a spell slot, will display the rules for ritual casting, and will change the title to reflect that the spell was cast as a ritual.\n- If you forgot to include spaces or apostrophes in spell names for `!Cast` or `!Qast`, it would only still match if the spell was actually known by the caster. This has now been fixed, refactored to use string.translate() and now also applies to hyphens.\n\n**9th Dec Update**\n- New `!undo` alias added! `!A`, `!Q`, `!Cast` and `!Qast` will now save an Undo State before the command is run, which is an ieffect that expires at the end of the current turn.\n- Ammo tracking and ray counting now works even if you don't specify any targets.\n- Fixed some issues with the `-sb` arg and now you can apply it to specific saves!\n- Added the `debug` argument for `!A`, `!Q`, `!Cast` and `!Qast` for testing purposes so you can see what command they're outputting without actually running it.\n- Targets will be sorted by HP (lowest to highest) when you cast *sleep* or *color spray*, allowing these spells to be automated. See below for JSONs.\n\n**24th Nov Update**\n- `!Q` and `!Qast` are now more forgiving of DMs who forget to `!init next` at the start of combat. if there's no current combatant they'll treat the one with highest initiative as the current combatant.\n- Fixed a bug with `!Cast` introduced by the last update.\n\n**23rd Nov Update**\n- Spell names will now match even if you forget to add spaces (e.g. \"firebolt\") or apostrophes (e.g. \"hunters mark\").\n- Fixed a bug where there the aliases would not display error embeds when intended because there was an extra \" being returned.\n- Fixed a bug where anything involving an attack roll would break if targeting a combatant that doesn't have an AC (such as one added by `!i add`).\n\n\n---\n\n__**JSON for automated *color spray***__\n```{\"name\":\"Color Spray\",\"level\":1,\"school\":\"I\",\"casttime\":\"1 action\",\"range\":\"Self (15 foot cone)\",\"duration\":\"1 round\",\"description\":\"A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand.
