My name is Valgim and I give warm hugs

This alias will allow the user to use the Bolstering Magic feature of the Path of the Wild Magic Barbarians. It can either add an effect granting the bonus to hit, or add an appropriate spell slot (choosing the max available given the roll).

**Parameters**

`-t <target>` - Chooses the target for the bonus
`spell` - Rolls 1d3, and gives the target back the highest available if in initiative.
`bonus` - Grants the target an effect in initiative that applies the 1d3 bonus to attacks.
`-i` - Ignore requirements, does not use a counter.
