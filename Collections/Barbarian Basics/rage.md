I would humbly like to ***RAAAAAGE***

`!rage` - Will start a rage on your active character, using your Rage or Rages counter. If you're in initiative, will add an effect to you, granting resistances and damage bonus.

**Parameters**

`-i` - Ignore requirements, does not use a counter.
`-t <target>` - Will start a rage on the target.
`frenzy` - Causes the Rage to be a frenzied rage.
`-image <image>` - Adds the image to the bottom of the embed
`-thumb <thumb>` - Adds the thumbnail to the embed
