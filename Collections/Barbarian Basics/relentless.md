Just because you killed me doesn't mean I'm going to stop raging.

This alias will allow the user to use the Relentless Rage ability of Barbarians. It will roll a constitution save, keeping track of the increasing DC, and set your HP to 1 if you succeed.

Takes into account initiative effects that add to save bonuses.

**Parameters**

`-b [bonus]` - Adds a bonus to the save
`adv`/`dis` - Grants either advantage or disadvantage on the save
