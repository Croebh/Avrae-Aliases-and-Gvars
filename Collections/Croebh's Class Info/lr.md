`!lr` performs a Long Rest, resetting all counters that reset on a long or short rest, spell slots, hit points, temporary hitpoints, reducing exhaustion by 1 if the counter exists, and appropriately regaining Hit Dice.
 
**Valid Arguments:**
`-b #` - Regains extra hit dice.
`-h|compact` - Hides pretty much all the extra counter text and condenses the embed into a more compact form.
`armor` - Uses the variant rule from XGE where sleeping in armor recovers only one quarter your level in Hit Dice and doesn't reduce exhaustion.
