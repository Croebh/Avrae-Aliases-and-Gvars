__**Map Utility**__
This is an utility that can be used with the !map alias or on its own. It shows distance between sets of cartesian coordinates.

__**Distance Commands**__
`!distance <coordinate> <coordinate> [height][,color]` - Will measure the distance between two coordinates. Example:` !distance a1 d4`
If you are in combat, you can also measure between a combatant and a coordinate or between two combatants. As an additional option, you can change the default color of the overlay if needed as well as include height. Example: `!distance prixaris h5` or `!distance prixaris go1,y` or `!distance f9 j10 30`

This calculates distances based on 5ft diagonals. If you would rather 'True' distances, run `!uvar trueDistance true`. To revert back, use `!uvar delete trueDistance`. You can also set this at a server level with `!svar trueDistance true`
