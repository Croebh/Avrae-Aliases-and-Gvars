__**Map Utility**__
This is a utility to use with the !map alias. You can move either your current active player in initiative or a targeted player as step movements. It will still tally up the total distance after the move.

__**Go Commands**__
`!go <distance><direction> [-t <target name>]` - Allows you to move your active characters token in different steps depending on the distance and direction given. Direction can be `n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw` Example: `!go 10e10s5e` would move your active players token 10 ft East, then 10 ft South, and then 5 ft East.

As an option, you can target someone else and do the same step movements to them. It just needs to be after the <distance><direction> commands. Example: `!go 15s15e -t go1`
